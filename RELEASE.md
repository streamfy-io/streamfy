# Release process

The full process for releasing Streamfy consists of 3 separate workflows, which are detailed below in their own sections:

1. [Pre-release workflow](#pre-release-workflow)
2. [Release workflow](#release-workflow)
3. [Post-release workflow](#post-release-workflow)

In the event that a release needs to be un-released, please follow the [Release recovery process](#release-recovery-process)

## Pre-release workflow

This is a mostly **manual** workflow

###  Create a tracking issue for Release

Create a [new issue](https://github.com/streamfy/streamfy/issues/new?template=release_checklist.md) with the `release_checklist.md` template

Prior to releasing, the release manager should check the following:

Review Streamfy website:
1. Review the "Quickstart" docs.
    - [ ] https://www.streamfy.io/docs/streamfy/quickstart
2. Review docs for key changes to ensure they are up to date.
    - [ ] https://www.streamfy.io

Other dependent repos:
- [ ] Update [`streamfy/streamfy-smartmodule-template`](https://github.com/streamfy/streamfy-smartmodule-template) if needed.

## Release workflow

This is a mostly **automated** workflow
### Let the team know before starting
Send a message in the Streamfy Slack `#dev` channel to let the team know release is about to occur.

The team should understand that **No PR merges unrelated to release should occur during this time**

### Run the Release automation

Run the [`release.yml` Github Actions workflow](https://github.com/streamfy/streamfy/actions/workflows/release.yml)

This workflow will:

1. Create [Github Release](https://github.com/streamfy/streamfy/releases) for the current version (w/ Release notes derived from `CHANGELOG.md`)
2. Create a git tag on the commit in Streamfy repo that was just released
3. Push Streamfy docker image release tags to Docker Hub
    - https://hub.docker.com/r/streamfy/streamfy
4. Publish streamfy artifacts to AWS S3 (via `streamfy package`) for installer
5. Publish all public crates in the `crates` directory
    - [`streamfy`](https://crates.io/crates/streamfy) and any dependencies
    - [`streamfy-smartmodule`](https://crates.io/crates/streamfy-smartmodule) and any dependencies
    - The rest of the crates w/ a version number that isn't `v0.0.0`

#### In event of failure in Release workflow
If any steps fail in `release.yml`, try to run it a 2nd time before asking in `#dev`.

This workflow has been written to be idempotent. It will only perform work if necessary. (Even if run multiple times!)

### Release Connector

Release the connector for the new version of Streamfy in: https://github.com/streamfy/streamfy-connectors.

If there is no major changes in the connector, then only patch or minor version should be updated.
## Post-release workflow

This is a mostly **manual** workflow

After performing the release, the release manager should do the following in order
to prepare for the next release and announce the current release to the community:

1. The automated workflow created an issue called [Release Checklist]: VERSION. Add that issue to the corresponding [milestone](https://github.com/streamfy/streamfy/milestone)
2. Update files in Streamfy repo, open PR (with the `?template=release_template.md` PR template) and merge
    - Update `VERSION` file for next release
      - [ ] Minor version bump the version in the `VERSION` file with `-dev-1`.  For example, if release was `0.10.1` then version should be bump to `0.10.2-dev-1`.
    - Update `CHANGELOG.md` file for next release
      - [ ] Add Platform version section (matching value as `VERSION` file) with a release date of `UNRELEASED` to
      `CHANGELOG.md` at top of file (but under the `# Release Notes` header)
        - ```## Platform Version X.Y.Z - UNRELEASED```
      - [ ] For version just released, replace `UNRELEASED` date with current date (format as `YYYY-MM-dd`) in `CHANGELOG.md`.
    - Create PR with the `?template=release_template.md` PR template and link the [previously created release tracking issue](#create-a-tracking-issue-for-release) to close.
3. Close the release milestone after the PR CI completes. This is located on the [milestones](https://github.com/streamfy/streamfy/milestones) page.

4. Announce the release on Discord (`#announcements` channel) and Twitter ([`@streamfy_io`](https://twitter.com/streamfy_io) user).

    - Discord announcement Template:
      - Aim to announce ~3 features max. If we have more, point out that release notes includes more)
      ```
      Streamfy vX.Y.Z is out! 🎉
      This release includes:
      * (Changelog feature 1)
      * (Changelog feature 2)
      * (Changelog feature 3)

      Link to full release notes 📋
      https://github.com/streamfy/streamfy/releases/tag/vX.Y.Z
      ```

3. Send another message in Streamfy Slack to let the team know that release is complete (so we can merge PRs again!)

# Release recovery process

This is a completely **manual** workflow

## Cleanup failed Release
In the event that the release automation fails, there is manual cleanup required before re-running the automation.

### Delete artifacts:
- Docker Hub
  - Delete the image tag corresponding to the release VERSION
- S3
  - Delete the version directory for `streamfy` and `streamfy-run` artifacts
  - s3://packages.streamfy.io/v1/packages/streamfy/streamfy/<VERSION>
  - s3://packages.streamfy.io/v1/packages/streamfy/streamfy-run/<VERSION>
- Github Releases
  - Delete the latest release with a version number (probably the top-most)
  - Delete any DRAFT releases

### Fix the installer
- `streamfy install streamfy-package`
- `streamfy package tag streamfy:x.y.z --tag=stable --force`
- Remove last entry in streamfy-run meta.json
  - s3://packages.streamfy.io/v1/packages/streamfy/streamfy-run/meta.json
  - This should be a regular release tag (x.y.z), not a dev tag (x.y.z+gitcommit)
  - Confirm that the installation script works
    - `curl -fsS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/streamfy-io/streamfy/master/install.sh | bash`

### Post Release dep update

* Update third party crates
